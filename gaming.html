<h1 style = "color: yellow"> POG/Highlights</h1>
<p style = "color: white"> I began playing video games shortly after my brother got his first XBOX and PSP for Christmas. I mean, I was <br>
never allowed to touch his controllers - but soon after, I was gifted my own and began playing FPS games like Call <br>
of Duty and Halo. I eventually dabbled into games like Forza, Red Dead Redemption, Assassin's Creed, and Tekken. <br>
I eventually got into PC gaming and really enjoyed that, far more than playing on XBOX and PSP consoles. I was <br>
determined to build my own PC - slowly obtaining the parts from my old desktop and adding new ones. I have finally <br>
built something I'm proud to call my own, and it runs every game I throw at it. With PC games, I have obsessively <br>
played Overwatch, CS-GO, Rainbow Six Seige, Modern Warfare, and now Valorant. </p>
