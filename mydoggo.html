<h1>My Doggo</h1>
<p>My love, my life, my best friend, my confidante! My dog's name is Sa-Seum, she's currently 4 years old, and a Labrador/Pit mix. I <br>
rescued her from a shelter in Alabama and brought her back to her new home. After four years in atlanta, she's grown accustomed to <br>
city living. The story behind her name is actually Korean, (Sa-Seum) or 사슴 means deer, like the animal! I gave her that name because <br>
when she was a small ole pup, her fur was brown and she used to frolic around like Bambi. But because her name was hard to pronounce, <br>
we named her Sauce for short and we actually fell in love with the name. Because she's got a really wholesome personality, sometimes <br>
she's a sweet sauce and other times, her stubborn temper makes her hot sauce. </p>

<p>The time I rescued her, she was saved with her litter of siblings - almost 10 of them, and they all looked so different. I chose her <br>
because when I walked into the kennel they were staying in, she was the little one that tucked herself into the corner. I was worried <br>
that nobody would take her in, with her being so shy and timid. So, I picked her up (which I can barely do now, since she's 45 pounds) <br>
and told her she has a home! But throughout the years, her personality really came up - and a big one being, she's terrified of a lot. <br>
For an example: loud vehicles, vacuums, lawn mowers, fireworks, insects, cats, and her own farts. But luckily, she's very much food <br>
driven and always eager to please! I'm always advocating for people to be more open-minded when it comes to more controversial breeds. </p>
